# Cyber Shield

Event Detector component of the QMLP designed for learning.

## Test Processing

The `text_processing` module provides utilities for cleaning, tokenizing, and normalizing event log data. It supports custom preprocessing pipelines and integrates with the main event detection workflow.

This module, `Cybersheildcopy.text_processing.py`, provides utilities and functions for processing and analyzing text data within the Cybersheildcopy project. It includes methods for text normalization, tokenization, filtering, and other preprocessing tasks commonly required in cybersecurity and data protection workflows.

Functions and classes in this module are designed to facilitate secure and efficient handling of textual information, supporting downstream tasks such as threat detection, data classification, and secure logging.

Typical use cases include:
- Cleaning and preparing raw text data for analysis.
- Extracting relevant information from unstructured text.
- Supporting machine learning pipelines with robust text preprocessing.

Please refer to individual function and class docstrings for detailed usage instructions and parameter descriptions.

#### Features

- Text normalization (lowercasing, punctuation removal)
- Tokenization and stopword filtering
- Support for custom preprocessing steps

#### Usage Example

```python
from Cybersheildcopy.text_processing import preprocess_text

cleaner = TextCleaner()
sample_text = "Check this out! https://example.com ðŸ˜Š #awesome @user"

cleaned_text, removed_items = cleaner.clean(sample_text)

print("Original Text:", sample_text)
print("Cleaned Text:", cleaned_text)
print("Removed Items:", removed_items)
```
